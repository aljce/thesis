# Alice McKean's Undergraduate Thesis
## Abstract
In this thesis we explore formalizing the AKS primality decision algorithm in
the Agda proof assistant. We begin with a discussion of the AKS algorithm, an
algorithm that determines if a given input is prime or composite. This algorithm
will guide the development of basic number theory in the Agda programming
language. This language is a dependently typed formal logic capable of ensuring
the correctness of mathematical statements. In this mathematical assembly we
prove the correctness of the exponentiation by squaring algorithm. Then we
explore the nature of recursive algorithms by convincing Agda that their
recursion is well founded and terminating. Lastly we provide a fully
formalized brute force primality decision procedure.
